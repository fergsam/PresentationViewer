# PresentationViewer


This is a Swift project that is designed to show PDFs in a way that is helpful for presenting them.

In order to do this, the application enables the user to upload multiple PDFs in order to present
them sequentially. It also allows for comments, both for individual slides and accross the entirety
of a PDF. The presenter can bookmark different slides and jump to them by double clicking on the
appropriate element in a table.

The program generally follows an MVC framework (there are a few documented exceptions that should be
refactored) and is designed to have an intuitive UI.
